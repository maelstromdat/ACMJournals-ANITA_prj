@inproceedings{Ma2012,
  abstract = {Abstract—Nowadays, the cloud computing owners lack man-
	agement and monitoring tools to ensure the performance,
	robustness, dependability, and security. To address this lim-
	itation, this paper described our experience with a lightweight
	monitoring framework using some extra development work.
	This framework performed end-to-end measurements at virtual
	machine instances and software in the public cloud. It monitors
	quality of service parameters of the IaaS and SaaS layer
	without modifying the implementation of the monitored object.
	In addition, we discussed the manager-agent and module-
	centralized architecture in details. All the modules make up
	the entire proposed framework to improve the performance of
	applications in public clouds.},
